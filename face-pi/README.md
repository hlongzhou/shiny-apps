This Shiny document `index.Rmd` features face detection via [pico.js](https://github.com/tehnokv/picojs). When a face is detected from your web camera (if you have one available), the simulation for the value of `pi` will start, otherwise the simulation will pause. See https://yihui.shinyapps.io/face-pi for the live demo.

This demo was first used in [my JSM 2019 talk](https://ww2.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/2019/onlineprogram/AbstractDetails.cfm?abstractid=304301).
